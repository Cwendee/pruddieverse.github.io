      <description>The Evolution: Resilience in Motion My career didn&amp;rsquo;t begin with code; it began with people. Starting in Customer Service, I learned to navigate high-pressure environments and solve problems in real-time. That curiosity and drive for growth led me into Service Assurance at Red Star Express (FedEx), where I ensure operational excellence.&#xA;The Pivot: Driven by Curiosity I have always had an unending quest for knowledge. While others saw a workflow, I saw a system that could be optimized.</description>
