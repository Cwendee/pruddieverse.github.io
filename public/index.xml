      <description>The Evolution: Resilience in Motion I didn’t begin my career with code; I began with people. As a Customer Service professional across health, e-commerce, and transportation &amp;amp; logistics, I have engaged customers in person, over the phone, and via email. These experiences sharpened my ability to think on my feet, solve problems in real time, and perform under pressure. The curiosity and drive for growth led me into Service Assurance at Red Star Express (FedEx), where I support operational excellence and reliable service delivery.</description>
