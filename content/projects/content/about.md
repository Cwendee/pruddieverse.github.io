### Hello, I'm [Your Name]

I am a **Cloud & DevOps Engineer** passionate about building resilient systems and automating the boring stuff. 

My journey into the **Pruddieverse** started with a fascination for how code turns into live, global infrastructure. Currently, I'm focusing on:
* **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)**
* **Kubernetes Orchestration**
* **CI/CD Pipeline Security**

When I'm not architecting cloud solutions, you can find me exploring new tech stacks or documenting my latest project.
