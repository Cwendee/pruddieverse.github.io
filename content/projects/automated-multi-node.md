This repository documents a hands-on project in **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**. I built a multi-node environment where a single Ansible Master node orchestrates the deployment and deep customization of professional web servers across an AWS EC2 cluster.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
To demonstrate scalability, I designed a 1-to-2 orchestration flow. This ensures that configurations remain consistent across a fleet of servers simultaneously.

## 🎯 Project Goals
* **Automate** the installation of Apache (httpd) and Git.
* **Deploy** a professional Bootstrap portfolio theme from GitHub.
* **Orchestrate** surgical content changes using Ansible and Regex.
* **Ensure Idempotency** across the entire infrastructure.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Configuration Management:** Ansible
* **Infrastructure:** AWS EC2
* **Web Server:** Apache (httpd)
* **Version Control:** Git

## 🚀 Execution & Verification
The following terminal output demonstrates the Ansible playbook running across the inventory. Notice the "changed" status, indicating the successful application of the desired state.

### Live Service Verification
Once the orchestration was complete, I verified the deployment by accessing the public DNS of the managed nodes. The customized portfolio was live and functioning as expected.

## 💡 Key Learning Moments
1. **SSH Key Management:** Secure communication between cloud instances.
2. **Regex Implementation:** Handle case-insensitive text replacement.
3. **Security Best Practices:** Redacted sensitive IP addresses.
