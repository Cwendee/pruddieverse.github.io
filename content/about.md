### The Evolution: Resilience in Motion

I didn’t begin my career with code; I began with **people**. As a Customer Service professional across health, e-commerce, and transportation & logistics, I have engaged customers in person, over the phone, and via email. These experiences sharpened my ability to **think on my feet**, **solve problems in real time**, and **perform under pressure**. The curiosity and drive for growth led me into Service Assurance at Red Star Express (FedEx), where I support operational excellence and reliable service delivery.

### The Pivot: Driven by Curiosity

Curiosity has always shaped how I work. Beyond following workflows, I focus on understanding systems and how they can be optimized. This drive to explore the "how" and "why" led me into DevOps. As I transition into tech, I bring with me years of **resilience**, **operational thinking**, and a **solution-first mindset** applied to cloud environments.
