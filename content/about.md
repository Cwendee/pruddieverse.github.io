### The Evolution: Resilience in Motion

My career didn't begin with code; it began with **people**. Starting in **Customer Service**, I learned to navigate high-pressure environments and solve problems in real-time. That curiosity and drive for growth led me into **Service Assurance** at Red Star Express (FedEx), where I ensure operational excellence.

### The Pivot: Driven by Curiosity

I have always had an unending quest for knowledge. While others saw a workflow, I saw a system that could be optimized. This determination—this need to understand the "how" and the "why"—is what pulled me into the world of **DevOps**. I am not just transitioning into tech; I am bringing a decade of resilience and a "solution-first" mindset to the cloud.
