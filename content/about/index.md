## The Evolution: Resilience in Motion

I didn’t begin my career with code; I began with people. As a Customer Service professional across health, e-commerce, and transportation & logistics, I have engaged customers in person, over the phone, and via email. These experiences sharpened my ability to think on my feet, solve problems in real time, and perform under pressure. The curiosity and drive for growth led me into Service Assurance at Red Star Express (FedEx), where I support operational excellence and reliable service delivery.

## The Pivot: Driven by Curiosity

Curiosity has always shaped how I work. Beyond following workflows, I focus on understanding systems and how they can be optimized. This drive to explore the how and why led me into DevOps. As I transition into tech, I bring with me years of resilience, operational thinking, and a solution-first mindset applied to cloud environments.
