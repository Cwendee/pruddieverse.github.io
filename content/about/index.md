I am a dedicated DevOps Engineer with a passion for bridging the gap between development and operations. My journey in the "Pruddieverse" is built on a foundation of automation, cloud orchestration, and constant learning.

I specialize in building resilient infrastructures and optimizing CI/CD pipelines to ensure that technical solutions meet human needs.
